## How does it work?

When the user first visits the website he/she will be prompted with information on the country they are currently living in, provided the location is turned on. Otherwise, the user will have to choose from the select bar at the top, which has all the countries around the globe, the user is given 3 tries this is only because the app uses API keys and when a certain amount of users is reached no data will be received back. You can also click on the cities scattered around the country to get a link to a live camera in the city.

## Technical Information

Mapyo uses HTML, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap on the front end, and PHP on the back end. The script file makes ajax requests to PHP files that each retrieve data from various API and locally stored JSON data. The location data is retrieved using the baked-in Javascript API.
